My submission for the 1330 Studios 2025 Q1 Modjam

A BTD6 Boss Mod with some cringe cutscenes

-Five tiers, each on rounds 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120

-Each tier introduces a new mechanic

-Has checkpoints: If you lose to the boss you can start back at the round the boss spawned for free

-Recommended to be played on Cubism Easy/Medium/Hard for background visual effects to work

-Difficulty is somewhere between a normal and elite Dreadbloon boss event. Dr Monkey can provide you with extra money to make it easier
