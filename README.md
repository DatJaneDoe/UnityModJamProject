I couldnt think of an appropriate name for this mod within the ModJam deadline.

This is one of my typical BTD6 Boss Mods

-Five tiers, each on rounds 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120

-Each tier introduces a new mechanic

-Has checkpoints: If you lose to the boss you can start back at the round the boss spawned for free

-Recommended to be played on Cubism Easy/Medium/Hard

-Difficulty is somewhere between a normal and elite Dreadbloon boss event. Dr Monkey can provide you with extra money to make it easier
